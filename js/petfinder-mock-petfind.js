This may be due to his open fontanel. \n\n What is an Open Fontanel?...\n\n When puppies (and human babies too) are born, the bony plates of the skull are separated and somewhat soft, allowing them to flex and pass through the birth canal. Generally after birth these plates gradually fuse and become rigid. The last place to fill in and solidify is the spot at the top of the skull where the four skull plates meet. If these plates do not fuse, we are left with a soft, unprotected spot at the top of the head that is called an open fontanel. In some very tiny breeds the fontanel may never close. A fontanel usually closes by 8 weeks but can sometimes close by 6 months.\n\n What if the Fontanel never Closes?\n\n A dog with an open fontanel may have a serious medical problem called hydrocephalus (water on the brain). Too much fluid on and in the brain creates pressure that effects development of the brain. Symptoms of hydrocephalus include seizures, blindness, lack of coordination, walking in circles, an large round dome on the head. There is no treatment for hydrocephalus.\n\n Living with a dog who has an open Fontanel \n\n  \n\n A puppy with an open fontanel can live out a normal life with certain precautions.

The shelter had initially listed her as a stray who had been hit by a car. Shortly after her rescue, she received surgery and was transported to a boarding facility where within a short amount of time, her scars were torn open again resulting in a secondary reconstructive surgery. Alexy's spirit throughout it all was unbroken, and at the end of July, she was rescued by Hollywoof to the Rescue and went into foster care.\n\nAlexy can best be described as a love sponge- she greedily (and deservedly) soaks up every bit of affection, kindness and touch from humans that she can get. Every person who meets her and looks into her large brown eyes will see a gentle soul. Truly, when walking down the street, Alexy will come up to every person and lean against them trying to sneak in a quick touch or a soft hello. There is no other dog we have ever met that elicits such a strong response, either; when you're able to have your eyes break away from hers, and take in every inch of her scars and battered skin, your heart is guaranteed to melt just a little bit seeing what she has had to endure, and what remarkably she was able to overcome.\n\nThe vets believe that while she may have been hit by a car, more than likely that was after she sustained life-threatening injuries from either being used as a bait dog or tortured by her previous owner. Obviously, we'll never know but as she continues to rehabilitate and show her true personality, we see that while she is fearful of other dogs (she will give off a scared, low growl when other dogs posture or try to approach her in a dominating way), when she is approached slowly in a non-threatening way, Alexy seems to really enjoy the quiet company of other dogs. She is also affectionate and craves the cuddles of children, which perfectly compliments her childlike, puppy innocence. On her recent visit to the vet, she also encountered a cat who was sitting on its owner's lap, and she quietly laid in her spot on the floor wagging her tail in positive intrigue.\n\nAlexy is available for foster or adoption in Los Angeles, but only to a family or individual who can appreciate what she may have been through and who is willing to work with her to reach a point of full physical and emotional rehabilitation; someone who may have other pets must realize that there needs to be separation, slow introduction, and supervision to ensure that future injuries never result (her scar tissue is sensitive, fragile to even a light scratch).\n\nIf you are interested in meeting Alexy, please contact Rachel atHollywooftotherescue@gmail.com, or 323-929-7311.\""},"sex":{"$t":"F"},"age":{"$t":"Young"},"size":{"$t":"M"},"mix":{"$t":"yes"},"shelterId":{"$t":"CA1962"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2015-04-27T01:04:00Z"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433549/1/?bust=1423431744&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433549/1/?bust=1423431744&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433549/1/?bust=1423431744&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433549/1/?bust=1423431744&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433549/1/?bust=1423431744&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"1"}]}},"id":{"$t":"31433549"},"animal":{"$t":"Dog"}},{"options":{"option":[{"$t":"altered"},{"$t":"housetrained"}]},"breeds":{"breed":[{"$t":"Chihuahua"},{"$t":"Basenji"}]},"shelterPetId":{"$t":"D2014009"},"status":{"$t":"A"},"name":{"$t":"Bennett"},"contact":{"email":{"$t":"info@thelittlereddog.com"},"zip":{"$t":"92630"},"city":{"$t":"Lake Forest"},"fax":{"$t":"(480) 772-4892"},"address1":{},"phone":{"$t":"949-427-0925  "},"state":{"$t":"CA"},"address2":{}},"description":{"$t":"Bennett is good with dogs and most people but can be choosy.

I am an extremely GENTLE and sensitive 3 year old red-nose Staffordshire Terrier. I weigh 65 lbs, but everyone says I don't look that big. I am always curious about what your are doing-I would love to be your shadow, your lap dog and napping buddy if it's okay with you. I know basic commands but what I really want is to feel safe and enjoy a calm environment, as I am hypersensitive to outside noises. I have been living with a foster since June 2013, and I have become so much more confident and little by little I have become less anxious around other dogs. I received training & rehabilitation for two months at The Fouche Way this summer 2014, and I am now even more socialized and confident around other dogs; I prefer dogs who also enjoy quietly meditating and hanging out, or funny spirited little puppies! I also love kids of all ages. I only want to please you and feel safe so I would do well with a knowledgeable family who understands that I will learn fast but need lots of assurances from you that you think I'm on the right track. I am neutered, micro-chipped and up to date on all my shots.\n\nI am also available to be fostered for a while in order to make sure I am a good fit for your home.

I was a good mom, and I am told I am a precious girl. I love to play ball and I will bring it back to you as many times as you can throw it. I love tug-a-war. One of my favorite treats is my peanut butter and yogurt Kong. I love to Chew on bones or bully sticks. I walk well on the leash and love to hike or even run. I play well with others but sometimes do get jealous when there are people around. I want your attention to myself and I would be ok being the only dog or if you have experience with large, strong breeds, you should be ok having me in the house with other dogs. \nI have two foster brothers, Caesar (an 80lb bull mastiff/lab mix), and Angel a 10lb pom. I LOVE people! I will show you how much I love you and express it with lots of licks/kisses. I am really smart and I will show you all my tricks: such as sit, down, shake, stay/come and I will even wait nicely at the door until you tell me OK! I love getting in the pool, and I am crate trained, well-mannered in the house, but I don't like cats. I would do best with an adult owner and older kids (teens). My foster mom says I am super sweet and super smart. If you will put some time and effort I learn quickly and I really want to please. Will you take a chance on me and give me a great home? I love my foster mom and home but really all I want is my OWN home for the rest of my life. If you take me home I will be a good girl and LOVE you until the day I die. I am a very loyal girl.

When their family had to give them up they were stressed, skinny and weary and really missed their family. They have gained weight back and are stunning looking dogs that catch the eye of people who comment on what good looking dogs they are.\nThey were raised in a family with 5 children, are extremely well socialized with people and love each others company.\nThey like to ride in the car, run on leash beside your bike and run hiking trails. They are well behaved and easy to control, walk very well on leash, sit when you snap your fingers and can plaster your face with big WET bully kisses.\nKing is not good with other dogs, probably would be with other females. \nTila is good with most other dogs and has a little white poodle she liked. They were separated for several month and when we put them back together for the first time they were ecstatic. Their previous owners used to take them to soccer, football and basketball games and they were great with kids.\nSince they are now 6yrs old we would like to keep them together and they are very good pets. Both of them are UKC purebred registered APBT's and Tila is a Purple Ribbon Champion line. I have all their paperwork going back seven generations. Please contact me if you would like to meet them and could provide them a safe, loving home. And if you have GRASS they might just love you as much as they do the Lawn!\n\nBoth dogs are FULLY Vetted and Ready for a loving Family to give them back their lives."},"sex":{"$t":"M"},"age":{"$t":"Adult"},"size":{"$t":"L"},"mix":{"$t":"no"},"shelterId":{"$t":"CA1962"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2015-04-27T01:04:00Z"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433571/1/?bust=1425355751&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433571/1/?bust=1425355751&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433571/1/?bust=1425355751&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433571/1/?bust=1425355751&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433571/1/?bust=1425355751&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433571/2/?bust=1425355751&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433571/2/?bust=1425355751&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433571/2/?bust=1425355751&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433571/2/?bust=1425355751&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31433571/2/?bust=1425355751&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"2"}]}},"id":{"$t":"31433571"},"animal":{"$t":"Dog"}},{"options":{"option":[{"$t":"altered"},{"$t":"housetrained"}]},"breeds":{"breed":[{"$t":"Terrier"},{"$t":"Saint Bernard St. Bernard"}]},"shelterPetId":{"$t":"D2014036"},"status":{"$t":"A"},"name":{"$t":"Mickey"},"contact":{"email":{"$t":"info@thelittlereddog.com"},"zip":{"$t":"92630"},"city":{"$t":"Lake Forest"},"fax":{"$t":"(480) 772-4892"},"address1":{},"phone":{"$t":"949-427-0925  "},"state":{"$t":"CA"},"address2":{}},"description":{"$t":"Mickey is an adorable, dog friendly boy.

When their family had to give them up they were stressed, skinny and weary and really missed their family. They have gained weight back and are stunning looking dogs that catch the eye of people who comment on what good looking dogs they are.\nThey were raised in a family with 5 children, are extremely well socialized with people and love each others company.\nThey like to ride in the car, run on leash beside your bike and run hiking trails. They are well behaved and easy to control, walk very well on leash, sit when you snap your fingers and can plaster your face with big WET bully kisses.\nKing is not good with other dogs, probably would be with other females. \nTila is good with most other dogs and has a little white poodle she liked. They were separated for several month and when we put them back together for the first time they were ecstatic. Their previous owners used to take them to soccer, football and basketball games and they were great with kids.\nSince they are now 6yrs old we would like to keep them together and they are very good pets. Both of them are UKC purebred registered APBT's and Tila is a Purple Ribbon Champion line. I have all their paperwork going back seven generations. Please contact me if you would like to meet them and could provide them a safe, loving home.
