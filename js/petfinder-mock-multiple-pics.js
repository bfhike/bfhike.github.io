My name is Frank, I'm about 2.5 years old & I'm from Puerto Rico. I love to be a lap dog & follow my foster mom everywhere!\n\nI'm currently adjusting to being in New York. The chilly weather was just horrible when I arrived but I'm welcoming Spring & loving it. I still think it's a little noisy here and sometimes get distracted by all the sounds but I'm getting use to it.\n\nI love to play & run around. Sometimes I get confused on what is a toy and what's not so my foster mom has caught me running around with a shoe or two but I don't destroy anything. I can also be nippy when I'm trying to get your attention so my ideal new home is one without kids. My foster mom thinks I could use a little polishing on my manners & I need slow introductions to strangers because I can get scared . I'm mostly housebroken & don't have any accidents as long as I go out about every four hours during the day & at night I have no need to get up and go to bathroom.\n\nI would be best as the only dog because I do like a lot of attention & tend to get a little jealous. I'm looking for a BFF to spend all my time with while I learn how to live the good life. Could that be you? \n\nFrank is currently being fostered in NYC and his adoption fee will be $500.00\n\nWe require an application, phone interview and homecheck. To see our application process before applying, visit our Petfinder shelter information page or visit www.nebostonrescue.org You can also complete our online application on our website.\n\nThere is a $10 application fee which helps to defer our costs. This does not in any way guarantee the dog you are requesting and applications are not based on first come, first served. Our goal is to carefully evaluate each applicant's individual situation to find the home that is best match for each dog in our care."},"sex":{"$t":"M"},"age":{"$t":"Young"},"size":{"$t":"M"},"mix":{"$t":"no"},"shelterId":{"$t":"NY644"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2015-04-27T21:50:13Z"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/1/?bust=1430171413&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/1/?bust=1430171413&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/1/?bust=1430171413&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/1/?bust=1430171413&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/1/?bust=1430171413&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/2/?bust=1430171413&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/2/?bust=1430171413&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/2/?bust=1430171413&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/2/?bust=1430171413&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/2/?bust=1430171413&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/3/?bust=1430171414&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/3/?bust=1430171414&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/3/?bust=1430171414&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/3/?bust=1430171414&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32017255/3/?bust=1430171414&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"3"}]}},"id":{"$t":"32017255"},"animal":{"$t":"Dog"}},{"options":{"option":[{"$t":"hasShots"},{"$t":"altered"}]},"breeds":{"breed":[{"$t":"Chihuahua"},{"$t":"Boston Terrier"}]},"shelterPetId":{},"status":{"$t":"A"},"name":{"$t":"Palomino"},"contact":{"email":{"$t":"amber@evessanctuary.com"},"zip":{"$t":"10036"},"city":{"$t":"New York"},"fax":{},"address1":{},"phone":{},"state":{"$t":"NY"},"address2":{}},"description":{"$t":"Eve's Sanctuary does not have a public location to visit, although we do weekly adoption events in public locations on the UWS.

She loves bully sticks, greenies, and any stuffed toy.   She likes the dog run but it takes her time to warm up and get comfortable to run around. She doesn't like kids younger than about 10 and she doesn't get along well with cats. She likes her space but will cuddle when she's in the mood. \n\nShe's great with other dogs. She lived with a large 80 pound dog and a small 10 pound Brussels griffon. She plays fine with them. She also lives with a 12 year old  child and is fine with her as long as she doesn't get \"rough housed\" or pulled the wrong way.

The owner's sister was coming by to feed her and take her for a quick walk every day or two. By the time we rescued her,  Princess had been living in the empty apt for 4 months and she was scared, depressed and lonely. We brought her to a wonderful trainer where she is receiving the training and socialization she's never had before. It takes her a minute to initially warm up to strangers but then she is super friendly and sweet.  She responds very well to clear direction, which grounds her and builds up her confidence. She's smart and responsive and would love obedience and agility training, anything to occupy her mind, and an easy going playful companion would be great too. She weighs about 40 lbs and is short and muscular, but not overly stocky...perfect for an active agile dog. She is spayed, healthy and up to date on her shots.

Due to years of abuse, neglect and abandonment, Susie and Paco have become inseparable. They long to be loved and just need someone kind and patient to give them a couple of days to build trust. Once they feel safe, they will love you beyond words. They will walk through fire for you! Susie is shy, sensitive and loves being held, while Paco is more outgoing, free spirited and confident, but equally as affectionate. They will watch you intently as you walk around the apt hoping to see a sign of encouragement so they can come over and cuddle. They are velcro dogs who are happiest being close to their person. The Shrimpies are about 8  years old and together they weigh only 10 lbs. ItÃ¢Â€Â™s hard to believe how much love their little hearts hold. For Chihuahua lovers, they are a dream. Both are smart, love positive reinforcements (e.g treats! ) and love to please. They are currently living in a group foster home where they do well with all the other rescues, but itÃ¢Â€Â™s overcrowded and they desperately need a home of their own. Susie loves to sleep under the covers while brother Paco keeps an eye on things. They are like Yin and Yang but long for a person of their own to love. We have taken very good care of them since they arrived, and both pups are crate trained, healthy and fully vetted, They are also spay/neutered, microchipped and up to date on their shots. If you can open your heart and home up to these two gentle loving souls, you will not only change their lives for the better, but your own as well. More loyal and loving dogs you will never find. To learn more about fostering or adopting The Shrimpies, please contact Jenny at 212.726.DOGS or email her at jenny.strayfromtheheart@gmail.com"},"sex":{"$t":"M"},"age":{"$t":"Adult"},"size":{"$t":"S"},"mix":{"$t":"no"},"shelterId":{"$t":"NY245"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2014-07-25T15:09:09Z"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/1/?bust=1396471880&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/1/?bust=1396471880&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/1/?bust=1396471880&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/1/?bust=1396471880&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/1/?bust=1396471880&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/2/?bust=1396471881&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/2/?bust=1396471881&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/2/?bust=1396471881&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/2/?bust=1396471881&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/2/?bust=1396471881&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/3/?bust=1396471881&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/3/?bust=1396471881&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/3/?bust=1396471881&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/3/?bust=1396471881&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/22754657/3/?bust=1396471881&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"3"}]}},"id":{"$t":"22754657"},"animal":{"$t":"Dog"}},{"options":{"option":[{"$t":"hasShots"},{"$t":"altered"},{"$t":"housetrained"}]},"breeds":{"breed":[{"$t":"Pointer"},{"$t":"Whippet"}]},"shelterPetId":{},"status":{"$t":"A"},"name":{"$t":"Hannah"},"contact":{"email":{"$t":"toni.strayfromtheheart@gmail.com"},"zip":{"$t":"10023"},"city":{"$t":"New York"},"fax":{},"address1":{"$t":"P.O.

She is sweet, lovable, adorable and cuddly!  Hannah is from Puerto Rico and like many other 'satos', she is a  gentle little soul who just wants to please. She is living with her foster mom and two dogs close to the Appalachian Trail right now and boy does she love a good hike!  We feel she would do great in a more rural or suburban  neighborhood, especially with a big fenced in yard and another dog or  two to play with -- that would be heaven on earth for this angel. There  is something very special about Hannah, she truly is a heart with four legs.

At a year and a half old, our gorgeous velvety white pit bull mix is loyal, gentle, fun loving, well grounded and eager to please.  Leah is one of those sweet, happy, friendly dogs that loves all people and is especially good with kids, who she has lived with before. She is also great with other dogs and could easily live with another good natured dog with medium energy who enjoys playtime. Her playful and engaging nature is perfect for an active home where she could get exercise and social stimulation. Inside, shes a dream...calm, housebroken, sweet and affectionate.  Her foster mom says that Leah loves to hang out, whether its plopping down on the dog bed watching her foster mom fold laundry or simply amusing herself when everyone is busy.   She is not a demanding dog. She has balanced energy, loves life fully and doesn't constantly have to be at your side. But call her name and she'll be up for anything anytime.  She loves having her energy directed...she smart that way! Her real happiness comes from being part of a family, interacting and wanting to please.  She embraces life and is very upbeat and outgoing. People who know and love this breed recognize what a wonderful dog Leah is,  so it was no  surprise she became the shelter's favorite when her family had to surrender her when they lost their home. Since that time, SFTH has been taking good care of her, making sure this 55 lbs amber eyed beauty gets the socialization and training that all dogs need. Now as a 2-year-old young adult, we want to find her a home where she will thrive and be happy.  Leah is healthy, spayed, microchipped, hw neg and up to date on all her shots.

It gives us goose bumps every time! Then look into those big soft brown eyes and you'll see one of the most engaging dogs ever, as our mellow Staffie - Mastiff mix waits patiently to be told what to do next. Its enough to melt your heart. Now 9 months old, Grover weighs over 65 lbs., and will surely hit at least 75 lbs when fully grown. With his big head and webbed bear paws and a soft stunning light brindle coat, goofy Grover has a happy go lucky attitude and already loves all dogs, cats and kids! He is extremely good natured and easy going. He walks so well on the leash and that he can be taken anywhere ...city streets, country walks, window shopping, even brunch! Grover has responded so well to training that even our behaviorist was impressed. He said he reminded him of a very pretty little tiger cub, with an exceptionally mellow demeanor and always looking for direction.  When Grover had to spend the day and night with one of our short term fosters, the man cried when he had to return him. Grover got his favorite toy and brought it over to him and dropped it at his feet, then planted his big fat head in his lap to comfort him. This is not just another pretty face!

Even though she is full of love, her owner showed her no affection and she was told in a mean tone to 'Go To Your Bed' whenever she got up. The only exception was to go out for quick bathroom breaks. Then came her angel, a neighbor who wanted to help this dear girl, and the owner agreed to give her up. The neighbor contacted SFTH and we arranged an evaluation with our trainer who saw such good qualities in Mindy. At that time she weighed only 37 lbs! Now at 50lbs, Mindy is a friendly girl who is good with people, children and other dogs and has proved to be a very fast learner. The last couple of months, she has really come out of her shell and has been getting lots of socialization and exercise. She has stopped pulling on the leash completely and now walks like a lady alongside her foster mom. She loves being outside and thoroughly enjoys a good roll in the grass, probably the first time she ever felt grass under her feet. With new found enthusiasm, life is a constant celebration for this beautiful 50 lbs girl.  Mindy loves strolling and  window shopping and can't get enough of the dog run. Today she runs and plays with the other dogs, instead of hiding behind the bench when the dogs come up to greet her. In fact, shes so happy in the dog park now, she doesn't want to leave. Indoors, Mindy is relaxed and enjoys a good cuddle on the couch. She is completely house trained and house broken.  She has her own doggie bed now and loves playing with her toys.  With the face and jowls of a Dogue de Bordeaux and the stocky body of an Amercian Staffie, Mindy is a beauty with her shiny red caramel coat and clean sparkling white teeth. She has a lovely, calm temperament... loyal, patient and will be devoted to her new family. She is very calm, easy going and friendly. She is not aggressive at all, but if necessary, she can be protective. When a drugged up guy came up to her foster mom, Mindy picked up her paw, put it on his leg and pushed him away! She is in fact, the best of all worlds, a real diamond in the rough.

He was having difficulties breathing, as if suffering from a heat stroke -- it was over 90 degrees under a steaming hot sun.  No wonder he collapsed! \n\nOur volunteer poured cool water over his body to bring his temperature down.  He drank three bottles of cold water and rested comfortably in the back seat of the car on his way to the vet.

He remains in boarding at the vet's office waiting for a permanent place to call home.  He is approximately 5 to 6 years old and weighs 56 lbs.  Although he is not fond of other dogs, he is very sweet and affectionate with humans.  So he needs to be the only dog, ideally in a house with a fenced yard.

We never found out why Guapo was left at this shelter. He was a sweet dog from the very start and already house-trained. He immediately brought joy into our lives. He is a Pit Bull with a little Great Dane in him and weighs roughly 60 lbs. He was not yet neutered, so we took care of the surgery. We think heÃ¢Â€Â™s currently 7 or 8 years old.\n\nIn 2011 we adopted Cricket, a pug-Brussels Griffon mix who weighs about 12 lbs. Cricket and Guapo took to each other immediately. They love to wrestle and play, and Cricket is the alpha in the relationship. Guapo is very gentle with her. They are best friends. We think Cricket is currently 4 or 5 years old.\n\nBoth dogs are affectionate, love to cuddle and listen well. They are friendly, get along great with children and strangers and are wonderful companions.\n\nGuapo and Cricket have been the loves of our lives for many years. However, we now understand that Guapo would be much happier in a home with a yard.  We live in a small Brooklyn apartment where the dogs are crated all day. This is not fair. Guapo has no place to run free. He shows compulsive behaviors that tell us he is not getting the exercise he needs (e.g., chasing his tail, chewing up his bed in his crate). He needs to be able to run free, and we have no place for him to do so. But now we have a child, jobs that require travel, and can no longer give these dogs the attention that they deserve.\n\nGuapo will thrive in a loving home with open space for him to run. He will do great with other smaller dogs, but has no experience with cats. The ideal situation would be for Guapo and Cricket to be adopted into a new home together.\n\nThis has been one of the hardest decisions weÃ¢Â€Â™ve ever had to make. We deeply care for Guapo and Cricket and want to give them the happiest life possible.\"\n\n************************************************************\n\n\nNo harm will ever come to Guapo and Cricket. The family feels terrible that because of so much traveling and a new child, the dogs are having to spend way too much time crated. They have arranged for longer walks to make it easier on the dogs,  but would love to see them happier. They will keep them as long as necessary but have asked us to help rehome them. \n\nFor someone with time and space and  looking for great family dogs,  please contact Beth at 347-242-0459\n\nGuapo is the big boy\nCricket is the Brussels Griffon"},"sex":{"$t":"M"},"age":{"$t":"Adult"},"size":{"$t":"M"},"mix":{"$t":"yes"},"shelterId":{"$t":"NY245"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2015-04-28T15:19:39Z"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/1/?bust=1429745222&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/1/?bust=1429745222&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/1/?bust=1429745222&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/1/?bust=1429745222&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/1/?bust=1429745222&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/2/?bust=1429745223&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/2/?bust=1429745223&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/2/?bust=1429745223&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/2/?bust=1429745223&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/2/?bust=1429745223&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/3/?bust=1429745223&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/3/?bust=1429745223&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/3/?bust=1429745223&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/3/?bust=1429745223&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31980382/3/?bust=1429745223&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"3"}]}},"id":{"$t":"31980382"},"animal":{"$t":"Dog"}},{"options":{},"breeds":{"breed":[{"$t":"Terrier"},{"$t":"Chihuahua"}]},"shelterPetId":{},"status":{"$t":"A"},"name":{"$t":"Nina"},"contact":{"email":{"$t":"toni.strayfromtheheart@gmail.com"},"zip":{"$t":"10023"},"city":{"$t":"New York"},"fax":{},"address1":{"$t":"P.O.

The mom is small in stature, weighing in at 12 pounds (we have pictures), Nina is 10 weeks old and weighs 8 pounds. \n\nIf interested in learning how you can bring one of these munchkins home email Marcela at: marcela.strayfromtheheart@gmail.com"},"sex":{"$t":"F"},"age":{"$t":"Baby"},"size":{"$t":"S"},"mix":{"$t":"yes"},"shelterId":{"$t":"NY245"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2015-05-04T22:08:42Z"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/1/?bust=1430493002&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/1/?bust=1430493002&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/1/?bust=1430493002&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/1/?bust=1430493002&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/1/?bust=1430493002&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/2/?bust=1430535349&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/2/?bust=1430535349&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/2/?bust=1430535349&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/2/?bust=1430535349&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/2/?bust=1430535349&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/3/?bust=1429892964&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/3/?bust=1429892964&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/3/?bust=1429892964&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/3/?bust=1429892964&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/31992686/3/?bust=1429892964&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"3"}]}},"id":{"$t":"31992686"},"animal":{"$t":"Dog"}},{"options":{},"breeds":{"breed":[{"$t":"Yorkshire Terrier Yorkie"},{"$t":"Chihuahua"}]},"shelterPetId":{},"status":{"$t":"A"},"name":{"$t":"Tobey"},"contact":{"email":{"$t":"patricia.strayfromtheheart@gmail.com"},"zip":{"$t":"10023"},"city":{"$t":"New York"},"fax":{},"name":{"$t":"Patricia Ortiz"},"address1":{"$t":"P.O.

He's only ten pounds, but this little guy has a personality twice his size.  Though his first year and a half were spent in neglect, Tobey's tail never stops wagging, and he has confidence to spare. You would never guess he's ever had a bad day in his short life.  He does crave the attention he's been missing, though, and would do best in a home where he's not left alone for long stretches of time.\n\nThis youngster is energetic, but not bonkers.  Opinionated, but never yappy.  He really is the best of both his breeds.  He will happily walk a mile or ten, greeting people and hounds along the way, then spend the afternoon curled up beside his best person or pup or even the cat (if they let him).\n\nTobey is quickly getting the hang of the dog park, though he sometimes forgets that he was recently neutered, and can get a little bossy.  But he's a fast learner, and his enthusiasm is winning over his furry neighbors, hound by hound.\n\nAlthough there are no children in his current foster home, he seems to be drawn to the kids in the neighborhood.  Especially the little ones, who tend to drop food.  (Tobey is no dummy.)  \n\nHis foster momma is concentrating on housebreaking, because once this guy gets the complete hang of that, he will be the perfect companion for a lucky person or family.  Just today, Tobey went to the door and whined a little bit to let his foster mom know he had to go out to do his business! He's learning!  \n\nWhoever adopts Tobey will get the best little companion who's ready to join you on all your life's adventures!  Tobey is healthy, neutered and vaccinated.

His owner adores him but she's too sick to continue to care for him. He loves her with all his heart but he's been obsessed with taking care of her, much like a little kid taking on the responsibility of caring for a sick parent. As a result, Sully, this incredible 5 year old 50 lbs boxer mix is not able to be a normal dog. Yet when the owner is away and the dog sitter is there, Sully turns back into the social butterfly he once was, playing in the dog run, hanging out with people and just being a happy go lucky dog. Once his mom is back, Sully only wants to be near her to take care of her and protect her. Sully is a very loyal and sensitive guy and his mom realizes that he needs to be with a healthy, more active family where he can be a dog again, instead of a caregiver. Aside from being extremely handsome and charismatic, Sully is also silly and clownish.  According to his Mom, Sully is the most trainable dog ever, super willing, quick, smart and amazingly agile. When she was well, he use to go everywhere with her... hiking, running along the beach, flying in the snow.  And at home, he is super low maintenance...fully house trained, a quiet, calm, easy going dog, a real hugger, very silly but also very endearing. Our trainer recently met Sully and loved him. He couldn't walk down the street without people taking notice. He said Sully would thrive in a home with good boundaries. He would also do great as a second dog. Sully is healthy, neutered and utd on his shots.  \n\nIf you would like to know more about adopting Sully, please contact Beth at beth.strayfromtheheart@gmail.com or call 347-242-0459."},"sex":{"$t":"M"},"age":{"$t":"Adult"},"size":{"$t":"L"},"mix":{"$t":"no"},"shelterId":{"$t":"NY245"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2015-05-05T18:22:37Z"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/1/?bust=1430778891&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/1/?bust=1430778891&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/1/?bust=1430778891&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/1/?bust=1430778891&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/1/?bust=1430778891&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/2/?bust=1430778891&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/2/?bust=1430778891&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/2/?bust=1430778891&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/2/?bust=1430778891&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/2/?bust=1430778891&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/3/?bust=1430778892&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/3/?bust=1430778892&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/3/?bust=1430778892&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/3/?bust=1430778892&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"t","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/32075669/3/?bust=1430778892&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"3"}]}},"id":{"$t":"32075669"},"animal":{"$t":"Dog"}},{"options":{"option":[{"$t":"hasShots"},{"$t":"altered"},{"$t":"housetrained"}]},"breeds":{"breed":[{"$t":"American Staffordshire Terrier"},{"$t":"Pit Bull Terrier"}]},"shelterPetId":{},"status":{"$t":"A"},"name":{"$t":"Ricky"},"contact":{"email":{"$t":"adopt@rescuzillanyc.org"},"zip":{"$t":"10017"},"city":{"$t":"New York"},"fax":{},"address1":{},"phone":{},"state":{"$t":"NY"},"address2":{}},"description":{"$t":"Meet Ricky!**  Ricky is ~5 years old, neutered, vaccinated, and microchipped.

I am really the ideal guy, mature, super affectionate, and just waiting to give you love.  I would also love to enjoy the great outdoors with you, nothing as good as a nice walk.   I walk great on the leash. \n\nEveryone who meets me, LOVES ME, even kids!  Lucky for you, I am housetrained, One condition... If you bring me home, it has to be a monogamous relationship, no other dogs please!  I do promise to be a wonderful companion, who will be great in the house and a cuddly bunny, Am I  \"the one\"? \n\nI am about five years old, and about 50 lbs., UTD on shots and neutered.

He's approximately 3 years old and weighs 40lbs pounds. Charlie was abandoned by a hunter in rural Virginia all too common for hunting dogs that donÃ¢Â€Â™t perform well. He was left to die in the woods alone and when he was brought to the shelter he weighed just 30lbs so small that many thought he might be a puppy. Due to lack of space and the overwhelming population of hounds in Southern shelters these guys are the first to hit the list for Euthanasia and his weeks became numbered to just dayÃ¢Â€Â™s when we began planning his escape! \n\nChalieÃ¢Â€Â™s funny and a little clumsy, bouncing and jumping like a flea when he plays. His foster parents have had a blast introducing this southern gent to the sites of New York and heÃ¢Â€Â™s even gotten to see some of his favorite celebrities! Charlie runs around hilariously in the dog run but at home, he is mostly content to lie down and nap. His foster parents say he gets compliments when they go out, from people of all ages. Charlie awaits his own family to create memories with and would be thrilled to find a forever home! \n\nCharlie is currently working on leash skills and feeling at home with the right people. While he adores human affection, he can be skittish. Charlie receives top notch training from Raise the Woof Dog Training and thrives with a gentle but confident leader. \n\nCommands: sit, stay, down, touch, off, roll, to your bed.Charlie is Crate trained, house trained, neutered, up-to-date with vaccines/ preventatives and ready to find a family to love!\n\nPlease note: If you are interested in adopting please fill out an application in it's entirety.
